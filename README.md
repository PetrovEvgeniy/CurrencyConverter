# Currency Converter

The Currency Converter project is one of the prerequisite Android projects of the Mobile Application Development course, held in the third semester of Technische Hochschule Ulm.

## Main Functionality 
The application's main functionality, as you can tell from the project's name, is to serve the user by calculating from units of one currency to another. The exchange rates are updated automatically (every 24 hours or manually from the menu) and the actual rates are fetched from the European Central Bank API.

## Additional Functionalities
The users are able to see all supported currencies and their exchange rates (by clicking on the menu item Currency List).
